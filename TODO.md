* Serde flatten HashMap<String, Value> into Config to find other declared tables?
* Capture stdout/stderr of some commands and only show on error, e.g. podman network/podman stop
* Shell command/artifact types
* Command artifact that runs a command to generate the artifact
* Smarter args handling for extends, e.g. cargo vs cargo test
